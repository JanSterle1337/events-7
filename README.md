### Database configuration

I left the key and all the info to connect in the firebase.js file. 
I wasn't able to export database since I use spark plan.

### Implementation
-CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, READ
-SHOW EVENT DETAILS
-SORT EVENTS BY DIFFERENT KEYS
-PREVENTION OF WRONG URL(shows not found page)
-RESPONSIVE DESIGN

!WARNING! I didn't implement the related-events column since I firstly thought was optional. I also don't understand relations really well in NOSQL(I always used SQL before)

### Questions
Through out the project, I learned a lot. I learned some new stuff in Vue.js and
I got the basic understanding of NOSQL databases. I still have some questions.
I don't understand why is querying so "hard" in this database.
I really had to read a lot of docs about how to make more complex query.
I think that with SQL everything would be much simpler. That being said, I would really like to discuss my implementation and ways of improving the current code.
